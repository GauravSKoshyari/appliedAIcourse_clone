                <h1>Obective of Applied AI/ Machine Learning Online Course:</h1>

                <p>The AppliedAICourse attempts to teach students/course-participants some of the core ideas in machine
                    learning, data science and AI that would help the participants go from a real-world business problem
                    to
                    a first cut, working and deployable AI solution to the problem.</p>
                <p>Our primary focus is to help participants build real-world AI solutions using the skills they learn
                    in
                    this course. This course will focus on practical knowledge more than mathematical or theoretical
                    rigor.
                    That doesn't mean that we would water down the content. We will try and balance the theory and
                    practice
                    while giving more preference to the practical and applied aspects of AI as the course name suggests.
                    Through the course, we will work on 15+ case studies of real-world AI problems and datasets to help
                    students grasp the practical details of building AI solutions. For each idea/algorithm in AI, we
                    would
                    provide examples to provide the intuition and show how the idea to be used in the real world</p>

                <h1>Key Points:</h1>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <p>1. The validity of the Applied Machine Learning course is 365 days from the date of enrollment.
                    </p>

                    <p>2. Expert Guidance, we will answer your queries in atmost 24hours.</p>

                    <p>3. 15+ real world case studies(includes 2 self case studies).</p>

                    <p>4. 30+ machine learning and Deep learning algorithms will be taught in this course.</p>

                    <p>5. There are no prerequisites for this course as we have taught everything from scratch including
                        python
                        programming.</p>

                    <p>6. We will also be conducting 70+ hours of live content based on students feedback and industry
                        needs.
                        We would cover topics to prepare our students better for real-world problem solving and
                        interviews.
                    </p>

                    <p>7. A mentor will be assigned to each candidate after the completion of 50% of the course
                        assignments
                        whose sole concentration would be on building the specific student's portfolio/resume and in
                        interview
                        preparation, mock interviews.</p>
